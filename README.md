# Parking Management API
REST API of a parking management application built for test purposes and written java / Springboot. The API allows to:
- **Register** a new Parking
- **Delete** a Parking through its ID
- **Park a car** in a given parking, receiving a ticket
- **Remove a car** from a given parking, receving an invoice
- **Retrieve** the list of tickets, invoices and parkings.

### Dependencies
The application assumues that a MongoDB instance is running on the same machine where the backend runs and listening to default port 27017. [Mongo installation guide] (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). A possible improvement could be dockerization to avoid introducing dependencies. 

### How to compile, run and test
To clone, compile and run, issue the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/valerioferretti92/parking-management-api.git
$ cd parking-management-api
$ mvn clean install
$ java -jar target/parking-management-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
The API can be testing by issuing HTTP request to the machine where the application runs at port 8080. The following shows how to test through CURL:

Register a parking:
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/parking' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"parkingId": "parkingId",
	"parkingType": "GASOLINE_CAR_PARK",
	"pricingType": "HOURLY_PRICING",
	"capacity": 3,
	"fees": {
		"hourlyFee": 0,
		"fixedFee":5
	}
}'
```
Delete a parking:
```
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/parking/zxcvbn'
```
Park a car:
```
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/parking/checkin/parkingId' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"carId": "carId",
	"carType": "GASOLINE"
}'
```
Remove a car:
```
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/parking/checkout/parkingId' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"carId": "carId"
}'
```
Get all parkings / tickets / invoices
```
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/parking'
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/invoice'
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ticket'
```

The values parkingType, pricingType and carType are enums which accept the following values:
- **carType**: GASOLINE, ELECTRIC_20KW, ELECTRIC_50KW
- **parkingType**: GASOLINE_CAR_PARK, E20KW_CAR_PARK, E50KW_CAR_PARK
- **pricingType**: HOURLY_PRICING, HOURLY_FIXED_PRICING

Car can not be parked in parkings that do not match their type. E20WKW cars can only be parked in E20KW etc...
